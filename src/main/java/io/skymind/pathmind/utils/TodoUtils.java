	// the details of the application yet.

	// TODO -> Constructors load from the database even though there is no data handling

	// TODO -> No authentication to see if the user is logged in. I thought it was better to wait until
	// I had confirmation about what authentication system is used (for example Spring's security framework).

	// TODO -> Lots of CSS is missing.

	// TODO -> Security checks to verify the ID are valid and NOT null everywhere before even making a call to the database.

	// TODO -> No real thought was given to cascading styles so none are cascading. I'm more focused on wireframing then getting the styles correct at this stage.

	// TODO -> None of the parameters are tested or safe. There are no null checks, there is no error handling if the result is invalid, etc.
